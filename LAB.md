#### Testing
* Use Cypress to test your app with the following scenario:
  * Create a new category item
  * Create a new expense related to that category item
  * Delete the entire category, which should also delete any related expenses
  * Use any combination of [assertions methods](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions.html#). You will get full points for testing if a TA can run your test suite in Cypress and see the full scenario occur.
