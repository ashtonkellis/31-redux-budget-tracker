###### CategoryForm Component
* should expect an `onComplete` prop to be a function
  * that function should be invoked with the CategoryForms state when the form is submitted
* should expect a `buttonText` prop to configure the submit buttons text
* should support an optional `category` prop that will initialize the state of the form

###### CategoryItem Component
* should display the category's name and budget
* should display a delete button
  * `onClick` the category should be removed from the application state
* should display a CategoryForm
  * `onComplete` the form should update the component in the application state

#### Tests (not required, this is a stretch goal)
* Test the following scenario using Cypress.io:
    * The user should travel to the homepage at `/` and immediately see the `Dashboard` component
    * The user should fill out a new category name and budget, and submit the form to display that new category on the page in an unordered list.
